## Welcome to my dev site for the Magento 2 Product Options pages.

#### Here's what I'm working on today:


1. lets consider collapsing the product information on mobile? or if you have alternate idea i'm open. I like the idea bc it will keep clutter down on mobile and allow max room for call to action at top (upload artwork button).

2. lets try squeezing 2 options per row for all options

3. upload artwork section needs 'email artwork later' checkbox option

4. we need to decide where to put some text explaining that we will match the colors of their artwork file. At top in upload artwork section may make most sense? maybe just a small 'i' information box at bottom of upload artwork option? or if you have ideas let me know

5. we would like the google reviews to live at the bottom of the product pages. 

6. almost all option headers should have '?' hover over that will display additional information about that option, just like dutchlabelshop, except upload artwork, size, quantity and comments

7. I think we can drop product name to quote sticky on mobile? looks a bit large currently and it repeats product name at top when you first land on page, so I think its ok to remove if you agree.
